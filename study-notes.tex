    \subsection*{Galilean invariance}

    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%27s_laws_of_motion}{Newton's laws of motion} hold in all frames related
    to one another by a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean\_transformation}{Galilean transformation}. In
    other words, all frames related to one another by such a transformation are inertial (meaning, Newton's equation of
    motion is valid in these frames).\cite{galilean-invariance} The proof has been given by the book on page 2.

    \section*{1.5 - Construction of the coordinates used by another observer}

    \subsection*{Why would the tangent of the angle is the speed in Fig. 1.2?}

    Suppose $\mathscr{O}$ and $\mathscr{\bar{O}}$ both start out at the same position where $\mathscr{\bar{O}}$
    moves along the $x$ at some speed. After $t_1$, observer $\mathscr{O}$ sees $\mathscr{\bar{O}}$ at position $x_1$:

    \[ \mathscr{\bar{O}}_1 = (x_1, t_1) \]

    Observer  $\mathscr{\bar{O}}$, however, still sees themself at $x = 0$:

    \[ \mathscr{\bar{O}}_1 = (0, t_1) \]

    By definition where ``$\bar{t}$ is the locus of events at constant $\bar{x} = 0$", $\bar{t}$ is the straight line
    that passes the origin and the $(x_1, t_1)$:

        \draw [blue,thick,domain=225:270] plot ({3 + cos(\x)}, {3 + sin(\x)}) node (speed) {};
        \draw (2.5, 1.8) node[right] (speed) {Tangent of this angle is $\bar{v}$};
