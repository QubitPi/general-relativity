    This chapter was raised by the discussion of \hyperlink{green-theorem-proof}{Green's Theorem}

    There are lots of texts around the topics of Riemannian Geometry. Here is a list of threads in which great people
    recommended good books on it

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/247415}{Riemannian and Pseudo-Riemannian Geometry}
        \item \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1546037/beginners-book-for-riemannian-geometry}{Beginner's book for Riemannian geometry}
        \item \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/499945/need-help-finding-a-good-book-on-riemann-geometry}{Need help finding a good book on Riemann Geometry}
        \item \href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19505/introductory-text-on-riemannian-geometry}{Introductory text on Riemannian geometry}
    \end{itemize}

    One will need quite a solid backgound in topology, and especially differential geometry. I would recommend the book
    series by Lee: Introduction to topological manifolds / introduction to smooth manifolds/ introduction to riemannian
    manifolds.\footnote{\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/tt2klk/comment/i2v4nud/?utm\_source=share\&utm\_medium=web3x\&utm\_name=web3xcss\&utm\_term=1\&utm\_content=share\_button}{Book recommendations}}

        This question arose because I noteiced Einstein dedicated a huge portion of his famous
        \hyperlink{sr-original-paper}{Special Relativity paper} on its application in Electromagnetism.

        In fact, Einstein was trying ridiculously hard to unify his General Theory of Relativity with
        Electromagnetism\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory}{\ldots Albert Einstein, who attempted to unify his general theory of relativity with electromagnetism \ldots}, Wikipedia}. Why?

        Relativity describes our Universe pretty good but works horribly in the microscopic world like subatomic
        particles, whereas Quantum Physics works from the opposite. Relativity is, in some sense, \textit{not complete}

        Those who are familiar with Maxwell's Equations know by heart that Electrodynamics is a beautifully
        \textit{complete} and successful theory. It has become a king of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that
        other theories strive to emulate.

        Studying Electromagnetism is same thing as studying the standard model of Physics which shall guide my study of
        General Theory of Relativity.

        ``There exists a model of the universe which includes a field known as the Electromagnetic Field. This
        model does a remarkably good job of predicting the observations we make in the world. It does so good at
        making such predictions that it is often phrased as 'existing in the
        world"\footnote{\href{https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/28010}{https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/28010}}
