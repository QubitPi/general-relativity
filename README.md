Physics is, as I view it, a quantified version of Philosophy on how world actually works. It's pushing the limits of
human knowledge to futuristic inquiries such as

- Will [Dark Matter/Dark Energy](https://youtu.be/6EavTTbuIq4?si=fAc1V1OW9LKJBCvk) bring the possibility of next-human
  generation technologies?
- Does gigantic celestial object, such as Black Hole, permit spacetime travelling into the future for humanities?
- Is there [another universe/world](https://youtu.be/GQTq1kufCLk?si=oOykmrp9u6xt-iJ0) that obeys a different philosophical system?

Astrophysics, thus, is my favorite branch of Physics and __those who masters General Relativity or Physics in general
has their best advantage to learn and analyze Business or Technical problems in a systematic, logical, and correct way__
as well

I, hereby, present my ongoing effort of
[__Study Notes on General Theory of Relativity__][Study Notes on General Relativity], the "Math" behind our universe

What I Learn About Learning General Relativity
----------------------------------------------

- Nothing comes up in its final form on its first rendering. 

How to Compile Study Notes
--------------------------

### Setup

1. Install [Tex Live][LaTeX URL] (version â‰¥ 2021)
2. Download and install [Ubuntu Font][Ubuntu Font URL]. For instructions on how to install a new System font please
   refer to the following links:

   - Linux users shall consult [this thread](https://askubuntu.com/a/191782)
   - Mac users can follow [this Apple support](https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/install-and-validate-fonts-fntbk1000/mac)

3. Make sure [GNU Make] is installed with

   ```console
   make --version
   ```
   
   which, when installed, outputs something like this

   ```console
   GNU Make 3.81
   Copyright (C) 2006  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
   There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   This program built for i386-apple-darwin11.3.0
   ```
   
   `make` should be installed in almost every Linux distribution and Mac user can install via `brew install make`

### Getting Study Notes Source Code

```console
git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/general-relativity.git
cd general-relativity
```

### Compiling Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Please be patient as the compilation takes some time <img src="https://github.com/QubitPi/QubitPi/blob/master/img/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%B7/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%B7-19.png?raw=true" width="5%" />

```console
make
```
